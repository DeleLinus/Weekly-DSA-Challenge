After the fork is done, the next step is to clone the remote repository (forked) to your machine. Go to Code bottom, copy the path and write in the terminal the command:

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER-NAME/NAME-REPO.git 
```

obs: switch YOU-USER-NAME and NAME-REPO to your GitHub username and the name of the repository you want to clone.

Go to the directory where you cloned the repository (with command line in terminal window) and create a new branch with the command:


```
git checkout -b add-NAME-BRANCH
```

obs: switch NAME-BRANCH to name of your branch

## Second step

Make the necessary changes to resolve the issue, save the files and send them to stage area with the command:

```
git add FILENAME
```

obs: switch FILENAME to the name of the file you changed or use 
```
git add . 
```

to add all files you changed. Commit with the command:

```
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```

obs: switch MESSAGE to a short identification

Make a push with command

```
git push origin add-NAME-BRANCH
```
